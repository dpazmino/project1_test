"Trends in YouTube Videos"

Proposal:

Using data from user interactions we will analyze the differences and similarities on Trending YouTube videos across the globe. 

We will be analyzing but not limiting ourselves to the following:

  Patterns with increased views during certain time of the year (seasons)
  
  During what times(am, pm) are people viewing the videos
    
  Finding the category of the highest trending videos based on their category ID
  
  Doing a comparison of likes and dislike vs. views and comments
  
  Likes vs Dislikes based on trending dates
 
  Likes vs Dislikes based on Published times 

  Comparisons of trending views by countries

Overall, we'd like to see which types of videos are being viewed the most depending on the country.
