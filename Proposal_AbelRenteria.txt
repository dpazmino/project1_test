NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes

Upon looking on the NYC OpenData site our group was drawn to the vehicle collisions data from the NYPD. We intend to use the data to explore where in New York City are the most dangerous areas for motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and if there is a correlation based on the time of day, date, or weather. This project would consist of using the NYC Open Data api to obtain the data and we would then use the google maps api to display our results on a heat map.
